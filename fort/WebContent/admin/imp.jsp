	<p><strong>Importance Of Fort Conservation</strong></p>
	<ul>
<li><strong> Need Of Fort Conservation?:</strong> Shame on those who think that there what is a need for fort conservation. The forts of Maharashtra are the real glory of Maharashtra, the real jewels of Maharashtra. Gadkot is not only the glory of Maharashtra but because it was consecrated by Lord Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj, this Gadkot in Maharashtra should be like a pilgrimage for every person in Maharashtra.
</li>

<li>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was most useful in creating Hindu Swaraj, the forts and Sahyadris of Maharashtra.
Every Gadkot in Maharashtra has a very vivid history in itself

It is very important to reason that the forts of Maharashtra are our historical heritage
And it is the primary duty of every person born in Maharashtra to preserve the forts and preserve them
</li>

<li><strong>Some Fort Conservation Organizations in Maharashtra:</strong> There are many fort conservation organizations in Maharashtra which are working 365 days a year to collect garbage from different forts, rebuild fallen objects, and maintain sacred at the forts.
