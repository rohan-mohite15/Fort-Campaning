  <p>The forts of Maharashtra are the real glory of Maharashtra, the real jewels of Maharashtra. Gadkot is not only the glory of Maharashtra but because it was consecrated by Lord Chhatrapati Shri Shivaji Maharaj, this Gadkot in Maharashtra should be like a pilgrimage for every person in Maharashtra.
Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was most useful in creating Hindu Swaraj, the forts and Sahyadris of Maharashtra. Every Gadkot in Maharashtra has a very vivid history in itself It is very important to reason that the forts of Maharashtra are our historical heritage And it is the primary duty of every person born in Maharashtra to preserve the forts and preserve them...
